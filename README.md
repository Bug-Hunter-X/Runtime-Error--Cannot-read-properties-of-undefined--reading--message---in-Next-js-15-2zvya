# Runtime Error in Next.js 15 App

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications and its solution. The error occurs when attempting to access a property of an undefined variable.  The issue is specifically highlighted in the `pages/about.js` file. 

## Problem
The `pages/about.js` component attempts to access the `message` property of a variable named `data`, which is not defined. This leads to a runtime error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'message')`.

## Solution
The solution involves adding proper error handling to check if the `data` variable is defined before attempting to access its properties. This can be achieved using optional chaining or other conditional checks, as shown in `pages/aboutSolution.js`.
